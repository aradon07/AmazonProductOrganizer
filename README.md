# AmazonProductOrganizer
This program will organize Amazon products using 2 sorting algorithms:
Shell sort and Quicksort. The user will have the option to sort all items found in a single category
by price, or they can sort them by star rating.

In This project, we aim to utilize a public dataset containing over 1 million Amazon
products which contain product title, brand, star rating, price, frequency of purchases made in
the last month.

We hope this program will be beneficial to the average customer who makes
purchases on Amazon.com.

The Dataset is a very large csv file over 367mb, so you will be required to get this file at the following link:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/amazon-products-dataset-2023-1-4m-products
