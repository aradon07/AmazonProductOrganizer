# AmazonProductOrganizer
12/5/23 The finalized AmazonProductOrganizer had to redeveloped for Python coding. Please open the file named "main.py" 
So this is the program to use to open AmazonProductOrganizer with CSV file, Quicksort and Shellsort.

11/24/23 WIP: 
- Currently uploaded a parsing class to read the CSV file. 
- This file can open the CSV file with 11 tokens. However, there is a delimiter issue, so it only reads the first 1 or 2 tokens correctly. 
- This file was originally compiled on Visual Studio.

Description:
- This program will organize Amazon products and implement 2 sorting algorithms:
Shell sort and Quicksort with the option to sort all items found in a single category
by price, or by star rating.
 
- a public dataset was used containing over 1 million Amazon
products which contain product title, brand, star rating, price, frequency of purchases made in
the last month.

- We hope this program will be beneficial to the average customer who makes
purchases on Amazon.com.

The Dataset is over 367mb and can be download from:
